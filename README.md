# ScrapQL

The design of ScrapQL was partially motivated by experimentation with GraphQL. One key idea behind GraphQL is that the requirements for an API can not be known on forehand and therefore it is a good idea to create a general API that lets the caller be in control of things. Since we don't know which type sytem the caller will be using GraphQL implements it's own type system in GraphQL Schema language specifically created for the purpose. Because of the generality of the interface the types are also necessary for describing relations between different data items. GraphQL is also designed to avoid costly roundtrips between the application and the server room. The application sends "an order" for various "items" and the server takes care of collecting those items before returning them all at once to the application.

ScrapQL bears some resemblance to GraphQL but is also quite different. ScrapQL attempts to preserve the roundtrip properties of GraphQL but is intended for well known data exchange in situations where the backend code can easily be modified based on needs of the frontend of the application and the main goal is to bundle and deliver the data based on a few variables. ScrapQL is implemented in TypeScript and makes use of TypeScript's native type system. The user is adviced to define the query types with [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) that provides type safe measures for (de)serialing the data types to (and from) JSON. The JSON can be passed over the wire in any shape or form. The ScrapQL library is used to define and iterate the query/result structure.

# Tutorial

In this tutorial we explain how you can use ScrapQL in a simple project with
customers and profit reports.  We will use the following database mock
throughout the tutorial.

```typescript
const example = {
  customers: {
    'c001': {
      name: 'Scrooge McDuck',
      age: '75',
    },
    'c002': {
      name: 'Magica De Spell',
      age: '35',
    }
  },
  reports: {
    '2017': {
      profit: 500,
    }
    '2018': {
      profit: 100,
    },
    '2019': {
      profit: 10,
    }
  },
};

type Json = unknown;

interface DB {
  isKnownCustomer: (c: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  getCustomer: (c: string) => Promise<Json>;
  getReport: (y: string) => Promise<Json>;
}

const db: DB = {
  hasCustomer: (customerId) => Promise.resolve(example.customers.hasOwnPropert(customerID)),
  getCustomer: (customerId) => Promise.resolve(example.customers[customerId]),
  getReport: (year) => Promise.resolve(example.reports[year]||{ profit: 0 }),
}
```


## Define Data Validators

```typescript
import * as t from 'io-ts'

const CustomerId = t.string;
type CustomerId = t.TypeOf<typeof CustomerId>;

const Customer = t.type({
  name: t.string,
  age: t.number,
});
type Customer = t.TypeOf<typeof Customer>;

const Year = t.string;
type Year = t.TypeOf<typeof Year>;

const Report = t.type({
  profit: t.number,
});
type Report = t.TypeOf<typeof Report>;

const Errors = t.array(t.string);
type Errors = t.TypeOf<typeof Errors>;
```

## Define Query Validator

```typescript
package = 'scrapql-example-app';  // from package.json
version = '0.0.1';                // from package.json

const QUERY_PROTOCOL= `${packge}/${version}/scrapql/query`;

const Query = t.type({
  protocol: t.literal(QUERY_PROTOCOL),
  get: t.type({
    reports: t.record(Year, Report)),
    customers: t.record(CustomerId, Customer)),
  }),
});
export type Query = t.TypeOf<typeof Query>;
```

## Define Query Resolvers

```typescript
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/lib/Task';
import { TaskEither } from 'fp-ts/lib/TaskEither';

import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/lib/pipeable';
import * as Task_ from 'fp-ts/lib/Task';
import * as TaskEither_ from 'fp-ts/lib/TaskEither';
import { failure } from 'io-ts/lib/PathReporter'

interface Resolvers {
  readonly fetchReport: (a: Year) => TaskEither<Errors, Report>;
  readonly fetchCustomer: (a: CustomerId) => TaskEither<Errors, Customer>;
  readonly checkCustomerExistence: (a: CustomerId) => Task<boolean>;
}

const resolvers: Resolvers = {

  fetchReport: (year) => pipe(
    () => db.getReport(year),
    Task_.map(Report.decode),
    TaskEither_.mapLeft(failure),
  ),

  fetchCustomer: (customerId) => pipe(
    () => db.getCustomer(customerId),
    Task_.map(CustomerDecode.decode),
    TaskEither_.mapLeft(failure),
  ),

  checkCustomerExistence: (customerId) => pipe(
    () => db.hasCustomer(customerId),
  ),

};
```


## Define Query Processor

```typescript
import { process } from 'scrapql';

const RESULT_PROTOCOL = `${packge}/${version}/scrapql/result`;

const processQuery = process.query.properties({
  protocol: process.query.literal(RESULT_PROTOCOL),
  get: process.query.properties({
    reports: process.query.keys(
      process.query.leaf((r: Resolvers) => r.fetchReport)
    ),
    customers: process.query.ids(
      (r: Resolvers) => r.checkCustomerExistence,
      process.query.leaf((r: Resolvers) => r.fetchCustomer)
    ),
  }),
})(resolvers);
```

## Running The Query Processor

Now that we have a query processor we can finally use it to process queries.
The query processor works as follows.

```typescript
const query: Json = {
  protocol: QUERY_PROTOCOL,
  get: {
    reports: {
      2018: true,
      3030: true,   
    },
    customers: {
      'c002': true,
      'c007': true,
    },
  },
};

main = pipe(
  Task_.of(query),
  Task_.map(Query.decode),
  TaskEither_.mapLeft(failure),
  TaskEither_.chain(processQuery),
)

main();
```

Executing main should return a promise with the query result. Which should look
as follows. The top level wrapper contains the result of the query decode and
should return `left` in case of an invalid query.

```typescript
{
  _tag: 'Right',
  right: {
    protocol: 'scrapql-example-app/0.0.1/scrapql/result',
    get: {
      reports: {
        2018: { profit: 100 },
        3030: { profit: 0 },
      },
      customers: {
        c002: {
          _tag: 'Some',
          value: {
            name: 'Magica De Spell',
            age: '35',
          },
        },
        c007: {
          _tag: 'None',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Define Result Validator

```typescript
import { option as tOption } from 'io-ts-types/lib/option';
import { option as tEither } from 'io-ts-types/lib/option';

const Result = t.type({
  protocol: t.literal(RESULT_PROTOCOL),
  get: t.type({
    reports: t.record(Year, tEither(Errors, Report)),
    customers: t.record(CustomerId, tEither(Errors, tOption(Customer))),
  }),
});
export type Result = t.TypeOf<typeof Result>;
```

## Define Result Reporters

```typescript
interface Reporters {
  readonly receiveReport: (a: Either<Errors, Report>, b: Year) => Task<void>;
  readonly receiveCustomer: (a: Either<Errors, Option<Customer>>, b: CustomerId) => Task<void>;
  readonly learnCustomerExistence: (a: CustomerId, b: boolean) => Task<void>;
}

const reporters: Reporters = {

  receiveReport: (result, year) => pipe(
    result,
    Either_.fold(
      (errors) => () => Promise.resolve(console.error(year, errors))
      (report) => () => Promise.resolve(console.log(year, report))
    ),
  ),

  receiveCustomer: (result, customerId) => pipe(
    result,
    Either_.fold(
      (errors) => () => Promise.resolve(console.error(customerId, errors))
      (customer) => () => Promise.resolve(console.log(customerId, customer))
    ),
  ),

  learnCustomerExistence: (customerId, existence) => pipe(
    () => Promise.resolve(console.log(customerId, existence ? 'known customer' : 'unknown customer')),
  ),

};
```


## Define Result Processor

```typescript

const processResult = process.result.properties({
  protocol: process.result.literal(),
  get: process.result.properties({
    reports: process.result.keys(
      process.result.leaf((r: Reporters) => r.receiveReport)
    ),
    customers: process.result.ids(
      (r: Reporters) => r.learnCustomerExistence,
      process.result.leaf((r: Reporters) => r.receiveCustomer)
    ),
  }),
})(reporters);
```


## Example Flow

Now that we have a query processor we can finally use it to process queries.
The query processor works as follows.

```typescript

async function exampleFlow() {


  const request = Promise.resolve(JSON.stringify(query);

  const response = pipe(
    TaskEither_.tryCatch(() => request, (reason) => [String(reason)]),
    TaskEither_.chain((body) => Either.parseJSON(body, (reason) => [String(reason)]),
    TaskEither_.map(Query.decode),
    TaskEither_.mapLeft(failure),
    TaskEither_.chain(processQuery),
    Task_.map()
  )();


}



```
